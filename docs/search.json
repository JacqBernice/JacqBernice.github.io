As a matter of fact, I am a proud Indonesian who was born and raised in that country. Here’s a proof that I am not angmoh:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I approach my 20th birthday later this year, I find myself reminiscing about my experiences over the last two decades. Having been a student nearly my entire life, I often wonder if my academic performance is affected by my gender or my parents’ education. In addition, many people have told me that if I prepared for tests, I would definitely ace them. However, I had experienced the opposite in the past where I thought I had prepared myself well but I ended up getting average grades. Hence, I decided to test whether a student’s grade is truly affected by test preparation, whether a student’s grade is affected by gender and parents’ educational background, and whether having lunch before tests matters."

This means that students of parents with higher levels of education tend to score higher on average on academic tests.\nHowever, it is important to note that correlation does not equal causation. There may be other factors that influence both parental education and child average scores. For example, children of wealthier families may be more likely to have parents with higher levels of education and also have access to better schools and resources."

The violin for “standard lunch” is also narrower than the violin for “free/reduced lunch”, which means the scores in the “standard lunch” group are more clustered together. The tails of the violins are about the same length, which means the spread of the data is similar in both groups. In short, the violin plot suggests students who had standard lunch might score higher than those with reduced or no lunch."
