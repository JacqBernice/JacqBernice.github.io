As a matter of fact, I am a proud Indonesian who was born and raised in that country. Here’s a proof that I am not angmoh:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I approach my 20th birthday later this year, I find myself reminiscing about my experiences over the last two decades. Having been a student nearly my entire life, I often wonder if my academic performance is affected by my gender or my parents’ education. In addition, many people have told me that if I prepared for tests, I would definitely ace them. However, I had experienced the opposite in the past where I thought I had prepared myself well but I ended up getting average grades. Hence, I decided to test whether a student’s grade is truly affected by test preparation, whether a student’s grade is affected by gender and parents’ educational background, and whether having lunch before tests matters."

This means that students of parents with higher levels of education tend to score higher on average on academic tests.\nHowever, it is important to note that correlation does not equal causation.

The violin for “standard lunch” is also narrower than the violin for “free/reduced lunch”, which means the scores in the “standard lunch” group are more clustered together. The tails of the violins are about the same length, which means the spread of the data is similar in both groups. In short, the violin plot suggests students who had standard lunch might score higher than those with free or reduced-price lunch."

    "text": "Gender Differences in Scores by Subject\nMy initial observation shows gender-based differences in overall scores as well as by individual subjects. It’s clear that while females generally score higher overall, males have higher median scores in Math. This finding could lead to further investigations into potential reasons for these differences, which might include societal expectations, teaching methods, or even inherent biases in the way subjects are taught or assessed. Additionally, the higher scores in Writing and Reading for females may reflect greater verbal skills, which has been supported by some educational research.\n\n\n\nParents’ Educational Background\nThe positive correlation between parents’ educational levels and student academic performance is a critical insight. This relationship suggests that parental education could be a proxy for a variety of factors, such as higher socio-economic status, more educational resources available at home, or a greater emphasis on the value of education. To explore this further, it might be useful to look at specific educational interventions or support systems that are in place for students whose parents have lower levels of education, to see if these can mitigate the observed differences.\n\n\n\nInfluence of Lunch Status on Academic Performance\nMy analysis of lunch status presents an intriguing contradiction to the claim by Anderson et al. (2017). While they found a positive impact of free or reduced-price lunches on test scores, my data shows that students with standard lunches actually score higher. This discrepancy could be due to several factors such as:\nEconomic Factors: Free or reduced-price lunch status is often a marker of lower economic status, which could correlate with less access to academic resources, such as books, private tutoring, or quiet study environments.\nSchool Resources: Schools with higher proportions of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches may receive less funding or have fewer resources, affecting the quality of education provided.\n\n\n\nEffect of Test Preparation Courses:\nThe data indicating that students who completed a test preparation course scored higher on average than those who did not strongly supports the idea that structured preparation and study can improve test outcomes. This effect might be due to better familiarity with test formats, enhanced confidence, and improved knowledge retention.\n\n\n\nFurther Investigation and Considerations\nTo delve deeper into these observations, it might be useful to conduct multivariate analyses that include several factors at once, such as parental education, lunch status, and perhaps other demographic variables like race or geographic location. This could help determine the relative impact of each factor while controlling for the others.\nAdditionally, it could be valuable to investigate qualitative factors such as student motivation, teacher quality, or school climate, which are harder to measure but can significantly influence academic performance.\nIn conclusion, while my data analysis provides important insights, it also opens up several avenues for further research. Understanding these patterns can help in designing targeted interventions that address the underlying causes of academic disparities."
