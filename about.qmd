## Self Introduction

Greetings! I'm Jacqueline Bernice Howard, a student at NUS majoring in Communications and New Media (I love CNM!). Despite my name sounding *angmoh*, I am not. As a matter of fact, I am a proud Indonesian who was born and raised in that country. Here's a proof that I am not *angmoh*:

As I approach my 20th birthday later this year, I find myself reminiscing about my experiences over the last two decades. Having been a student nearly my entire life, I often wonder if my academic performance is affected by my gender or my parents' education. In addition, many people have told me that if I prepared for tests, I would definitely ace them. However, I had experienced the opposite in the past where I thought I had prepared myself well but I ended up getting average grades. Hence, I decided to test whether a student's grade is truly affected by test preparation, whether a student's grade is affected by gender and parents' educational background, and whether having lunch before tests matters.
