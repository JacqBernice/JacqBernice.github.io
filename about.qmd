## Self Introduction

Greetings! I'm Jacqueline Bernice Howard, a student at NUS majoring in Communications and New Media (I love CNM!). Despite my name sounding *angmoh*, I am not. As a matter of fact, I am a proud Indonesian who was born and raised in that country. Here's a proof that I am not *angmoh*:

With my 20th birthday coming up later in September this year, I find myself reminiscing about the experiences that I have had over the past two decades. Growing up, animation movies played a significant role in my life. As a child, I was always a Disney fan (or perhaps a Disney princess wannabe, but a girl can always dream, can't she?). As someone who watches Disney movies regularly, my interest has expanded to those from other companies like Pixar and Mattel as well. I would like to believe that any age group can enjoy these animation movies, regardless of whether they are kids, teenagers, adults, or even senior citizens. The fact that animation movies bring people of all ages together is one of the reasons I enjoy watching them so much.

The love I have for these movies made me decide to present a data story regarding animation movies. I am specifically interested in finding out if the popularity of a movie is related to its genre and the year in which it was released.
