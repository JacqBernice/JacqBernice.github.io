## Glimpse of Study Performance

The variables in the "study_performance" data-set are as the following:

-   "Gender" to indicate sex of students (female or male)

-   "Race_Ethnicity" to indicate which racial group the students belong to

-   "Parental_Level_Of_Education" to indicate students' parents final education (bachelor's degree, some college, master's degree, associate's degree, high school)

-   "Lunch" to indicate whether students had their lunch before test (standard or free/reduced)

-   "Test_Preparation_Course" to indicate whether students had completed their test preparation or not

-   "Math_Score" to indicate students' score in Maths

-   "Reading_Score" to indicate students' score in Reading

-   "Writing_Score" to indicate students' score in Writing

-   "Average_Score" to indicate students' average score from all tests combined

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
study <- read.csv("study_performance.csv")
study <- study %>% mutate(Average_Score = round((Math_Score + Writing_Score + Reading_Score)/3))
glimpse(study)
```

## Comparing Score by Gender

By comparing scores, we can identify any gaps in academic performance between genders. This analysis can reveal whether one gender consistently outperforms the other in certain subjects or overall academic achievement.

### Comparing Score by Gender, on average

As seen on the plot below, the median score appears to be higher for females than for males. However, the spread of scores appears to be larger for males than for females.

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(study, aes(x = Gender, y = Average_Score, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Average Score", title = "Average Score by Gender")
```

### Comparing Score by Gender, in each subjects (Math, Writing, Reading)

However, upon looking how both genders scored in each subjects, we learned that the median score is higher for males than females in Math. On the other hand, females still tend to score higher than males in the two other subjects (Writing and Reading).

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(data = study, aes(x = Gender, y = Math_Score, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Math Score") +
  ggtitle("Math Scores by Gender")

ggplot(data = study, aes(x = Gender, y = Writing_Score, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Writing Score") +
  ggtitle("Writing Scores by Gender")

ggplot(data = study, aes(x = Gender, y = Reading_Score, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Reading Score") +
  ggtitle("Reading Scores by Gender")
```

## Parent's Educational Background and Child's Academic Performance: Are they related?

Upon looking at scores comparison across both genders which shows that females tend to score higher than males, it comes to the question whether other factors such as students' parents educational background influence the students or children's academic performances.

According to the plot and histograms below, there is a **positive correlation** between parents' educational background and students' academic performances (average score). This means that students of parents with higher levels of education tend to score higher on average on academic tests.

However, it is important to note that <u>correlation does not equal causation</u>. There may be other factors that influence both parental education and child average scores. For example, children of wealthier families may be more likely to have parents with higher levels of education and also have access to better schools and resources.

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(study, aes(x = Parental_Level_Of_Education, y = Average_Score)) +
  geom_point() +  # Add points
  labs(x = "Parent Education", y = "Academic Performance") +  # Labels for axes
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
        
ggplot(study, aes(x = Average_Score, fill = as.factor(Parental_Level_Of_Education))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, position = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Average Score", fill = "Parent Education") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Pre-test Lunch: Does it matter?

According to [Anderson et al. (2017)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23218), students with free or reduced-price lunches experienced more positive impact on test scores compared to those with standard lunches. Here, I will test whether students who ate free or reduced-price lunches indeed do better on tests than those who had standard lunches.

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(study, aes(x = Lunch, y = Average_Score, fill = Lunch)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = "white", outlier.shape = NA) +
  labs(x = "Lunch", y = "Average Test Score", fill = "Lunch") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```

Based on the violin plot above, it appears that students with standard lunch has a higher median score than students who had free/reduced-price lunch. The violin for "standard lunch" is also narrower than the violin for "free/reduced lunch", which means the scores in the "standard lunch" group are more clustered together. The tails of the violins are about the same length, which means the spread of the data is similar in both groups. In short, the violin plot suggests **students who had standard lunch might score higher than those with free or reduced-price lunch**.

## Do well-prepared students always score higher than those who didn't prepare?

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(study, aes(x = Average_Score, fill = Test_Preparation_Course)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Average Test Score", y = "Density")


```

The group labeled "Completed" appears to have a higher average test score than the group labeled "None". The average score for the "Completed" group is around 75, while the average score for the "None" group is closer to 50. Overall, the graph suggests that taking a test preparation course may be associated with higher test scores.

When in doubt, do a T-test and let the numbers prove it:
