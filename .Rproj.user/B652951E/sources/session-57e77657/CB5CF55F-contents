##### **(1) What is the topic that you have finalized?**
<br>
My final topic for the project would be Animation Movies. Specifically, I would like to identify and and analyse any relationships between the movies' popularity with their genres and released dates. 

<br>

##### **(2) What are the data sources that you have curated so far?**
<br>
So far, I've only curated one data source, that is a dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushchandramaurya/animation-movies.
