---

## Background

Academic performance is a multifaceted construct influenced by various factors that interact in complex ways. As a student myself, understanding the determinants of academic success is crucial for me to maintain my grades. Additionally, this helps to answer my curiosity on whether food is really key to excelling in studies.

## Aim

My analysis of study performance aims to delve into the diverse factors that impact study performance, shedding light on both individual and situational variables that contribute to academic outcomes.

## About Data Set

The data set that I am using for my analysis is from Kaggle by BHAVIK JIKADARA titled: "**Student Study Performance**". The data-set contains marks secured by students in different subjects namely, Mathematics, Writing, and Reading, the students' parents educational background, their test preparation course completion status, etc. The following is a glimpse of the data set:

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
study <- read.csv("study_performance.csv")
glimpse(study)

```
