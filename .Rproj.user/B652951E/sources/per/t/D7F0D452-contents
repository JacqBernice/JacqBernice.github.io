When you run a t-test, you get two main numbers: the t-value and the p-value. The t-value tells you how big the difference is between the two groups. If the t-value is big, it means there's a noticeable difference between the groups. The p-value tells you the probability that the difference you see is just due to random chance. For example, it might tell you there's only a 5% chance that the difference happened by luck. If the p-value is really small (usually less than 0.05), it suggests the difference is real and not just random chance."),
