## Visualization

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
study <- read.csv("study_performance.csv")
study <- study %>% mutate(average_score = round((math_score + writing_score + reading_score) / 3))
```

The variables that we are visualizing would be:

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
names(study)[c(1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)]
```

Gender and Average Score: Is there any difference between female and male?

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(study, aes(x = gender, y = average_score, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  # Box plot
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Average Score", title = "Average Score by Gender") +
  theme_minimal()  # Minimal theme

```

The median score appears to be higher for females than for males. However, the spread of scores appears to be larger for males than for females. One of the reasons for this might be that there are other factors besides gender that influence the test score, and these factors might have a larger effect on males than females.

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
t.test(study$average_score ~ study$gender, var.equal = TRUE)
```

<br>

But, how about within each subject (Math, Writing, Reading)?

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data = study, aes(x = gender, y = math_score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Math Score") +
  ggtitle("Math Scores by Gender")

ggplot(data = study, aes(x = gender, y = writing_score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Writing Score") +
  ggtitle("Writing Scores by Gender")

ggplot(data = study, aes(x = gender, y = reading_score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Reading Score") +
  ggtitle("Reading Scores by Gender")
```

<br>

Interestingly, when both genders are plotted against all three subjects, males appear to score higher in all subjects.  There could be a number of reasons for this. For example, males might be more interested in certain subjects than females, or they might have had better teachers in those subjects.
