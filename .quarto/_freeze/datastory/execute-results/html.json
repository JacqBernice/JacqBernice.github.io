However, the spread of scores appears to be larger for males than for females. One of the reasons for this might be that there are other factors besides gender that influence the test score, and these factors might have a larger effect on males than females.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tTwo Sample t-test\n\ndata:  study$average_score by study$gender\nt = 4.19, df = 998, p-value = 3.036e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group female and group male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 1.993744 5.506248\nsample estimates:\nmean in group female   mean in group male \n             69.5695              65.8195 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nBut, how about within each subject (Math, Writing, Reading)?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datastory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datastory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datastory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nInterestingly, when both genders are plotted against all three subjects, males appear to score higher in all subjects.  There could be a number of reasons for this. For example, males might be more interested in certain subjects than females, or they might have had better teachers in those subjects.\n",
