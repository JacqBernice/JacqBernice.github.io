This analysis can reveal whether one gender consistently outperforms the other in certain subjects or overall academic achievement.\n\nAs seen from the plot...\n\n<br>\n\n### Comparing Score by Gender, on average\n\nAs seen on the plot below, the median score appears to be higher for females than for males. However, the spread of scores appears to be larger for males than for females.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datainsights_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Comparing Score by Gender, in each subjects (Math, Writing, Reading)\n\nThis is also evident when comparing both genders' scores in respective subjects.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datainsights_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datainsights_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datainsights_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Parent's Educational Background and Child's Academic Performance: Are they related?\n\nUpon looking at scores comparison across both genders which shows that females tend to score higher than males, it comes to the question whether other factors such as students' parents educational background influence the students or children's academic performances.\n\nAccording to the plot below, there is a **positive correlation** between parents' educational background and students' academic performances (average score). This means that students of parents with higher levels of education tend to score higher on average on academic tests.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that <u>correlation does not equal causation</u>. There may be other factors that influence both parental education and child average scores. For example, children of wealthier families may be more likely to have parents with higher levels of education and also have access to better schools and resources.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datainsights_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datainsights_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Pre-test Lunch: Does it matter?\n\nIt is vital to properly nourish the body if you want to succeed in your studies, according to... Here, I will test whether students who ate standard or normal lunch do better on tests than those who didn't eat lunch or had reduced portions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datainsights_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the violin plot above, it appears that students with standard lunch has a higher median score than students who had free/reduced lunch. The violin for \"standard lunch\" is also narrower than the violin for \"free/reduced lunch\", which means the scores in the \"standard lunch\" group are more clustered together. The tails of the violins are about the same length, which means the spread of the data is similar in both groups. In short, the violin plot suggests **students who had standard lunch might score higher than those with reduced or no lunch**.\n\n<br>\n\n## Do well-prepared students always score higher than those who didn't prepare?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datainsights_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe group labeled \"Completed\" appears to have a higher average test score than the group labeled \"None\".  The average score for the \"Completed\" group is around 75, while the average score for the \"None\" group is closer to 50. Overall, the graph suggests that taking a test preparation course may be associated with higher test scores.\n\n<br>\n\n## More support: T-Tests\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'shiny' was built under R version 4.3.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`<div style=\"width: 100% ; height: 400px ; text-align: center; box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\" class=\"muted well\">Shiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents</div>`{=html}\n:::\n:::",
