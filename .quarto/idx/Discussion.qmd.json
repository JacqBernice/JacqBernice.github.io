This finding could lead to further investigations into potential reasons for these differences, which might include societal expectations, teaching methods, or even inherent biases in the way subjects are taught or assessed.

This relationship suggests that parental education could be a proxy for a variety of factors, such as higher socio-economic status, more educational resources available at home, or a greater emphasis on the value of education. To explore this further, it might be useful to look at specific educational interventions or support systems that are in place for students whose parents have lower levels of education, to see if these can mitigate the observed differences.\n\n<br>\n\n### Influence of Lunch Status on Academic Performance\n\nMy analysis of lunch status presents an intriguing contradiction to the claim by Anderson et al. (2017). While they found a positive impact of free or reduced-price lunches on test scores, my data shows that students with standard lunches actually score higher. This discrepancy could be due to several factors such as:\n\n**Economic Factors:** Free or reduced-price lunch status is often a marker of lower economic status, which could correlate with less access to academic resources, such as books, private tutoring, or quiet study environments.\n\n**School Resources:** Schools with higher proportions of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches may receive less funding or have fewer resources, affecting the quality of education provided.\n\n<br>\n\n### **Effect of Test Preparation Courses:**\n\nThe data indicating that students who completed a test preparation course scored higher on average than those supports the idea that structured preparation and study can improve test outcomes.
